# 🧩 TASK 3: Infrastructure as Code (IaC) with Terraform

## 🎯 Objective
To **provision a local Docker container** using **Terraform**, demonstrating Infrastructure as Code (IaC) principles.

---

## 🧰 Tools Used
- **Terraform** – for defining and managing infrastructure as code  
- **Docker** – for creating and running containers locally  

---

## 📦 Deliverables
- **`main.tf`** – Terraform configuration file  
- **Execution Logs** – outputs from Terraform commands (`init`, `plan`, `apply`, `destroy`)

---

## 🧠 Concept Overview
Infrastructure as Code (IaC) allows developers to **define, provision, and manage infrastructure** through code rather than manual setup.  
In this task, Terraform is used to automatically deploy a Docker container on the local system.

---

## ⚙️ Summary of Steps

### **Step 1: Environment Setup**
- Install and start Docker.  
- Install Terraform and verify using:
  ```bash
  terraform -version
  docker --version
